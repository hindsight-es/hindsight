Module      : Hindsight.Store.Parsing
Description : Event parsing utilities for event stores
Copyright   : (c) 2024
License     : BSD3
Maintainer  : maintainer@example.com
Stability   : experimental

This module provides core event parsing utilities used by all event store backends
to convert stored events into properly typed event envelopes. These utilities handle
version-aware parsing and envelope creation.

These utilities are shared across Memory, Filesystem, and PostgreSQL backends
for consistent event parsing and envelope construction.

{- | Parse event payload from JSON using the event's parse map with proper version handling

This function implements correct version-aware parsing:
1. Uses the stored event version to select the appropriate parser
2. The parser automatically migrates to the latest version via MigrateVersion
3. Returns the current version payload type

{- | Parse stored event data into an event envelope

This function handles the database â†’ envelope conversion with proper version handling:
1. Takes raw event data from storage (JSON + version + metadata)

3. Automatically upgrades to the latest version
4. Creates a properly typed event envelope
