  Analysis and Hypotheses

  Based on these diagrams and the code analysis, here are my hypotheses for the race condition:

  Hypothesis 1: EventDispatcher Initialization Incomplete ‚≠ê Most Likely

  The EventDispatcher.start function waits for readySignal, but there's a gap between when the dispatcher is "ready" (signaled) and when it's actually processing events correctly. The
  evidence:
  - Adding a delay after EventDispatcher.start fixes the issue
  - The dispatcher might signal ready before the notification loop is fully operational
  - The forever loop starts after putMVar readySignal, creating a timing window

  Hypothesis 2: LISTEN Command Effectiveness Delay

  PostgreSQL's LISTEN might not be immediately effective after setup. While the connection is established and LISTEN is called, there might be a brief window where notifications are lost.
  Evidence:
  - Adding delay after LISTEN setup (before processPendingEvents) also fixes the issue
  - PostgreSQL documentation warns about LISTEN timing issues

  Hypothesis 3: Initial Position Synchronization

  During initialization, getLatestPositionFromDatabase is called twice:
  1. In EventDispatcher.start (line 216)
  2. In processPendingEvents during initialization (line 460)

  If events are inserted between these calls, the dispatcher's view of "latest position" might be inconsistent.

  Hypothesis 4: Subscription Activation Race

  When a subscription transitions from catch-up to active:
  1. It registers with dispatcher (gets added to subscriptions map)
  2. Performs catch-up if needed
  3. Calls activateSubscription to set status to Active

  If events arrive during this transition, they might be lost because:
  - The subscription is registered but not yet active
  - The dispatcher sees it in the map but skips it (not Active)
  - Events inserted during this window are never delivered

  Hypothesis 5: Test Timing Creates Perfect Storm

  The test sequence might create the perfect timing for the race:
  1. Store creation completes
  2. Test immediately inserts events (triggering NOTIFY)
  3. Test immediately creates subscription
  4. The dispatcher receives the NOTIFY but isn't ready to process it correctly
  5. The subscription waits forever for events that were already notified

  Root Cause Assessment

  The most likely root cause is Hypothesis 1 combined with Hypothesis 4. The EventDispatcher signals it's ready before it's actually in its main processing loop, and subscriptions can
  register and activate during this critical window, leading to lost events or notifications.

  The fix would be to ensure the EventDispatcher is fully in its processing loop before signaling ready, or to implement a more robust event recovery mechanism that doesn't rely on perfect
  notification timing.
