{-
Note: The above functions are stubs for PostgreSQL-specific features.
In a full implementation, these would test:

1. Synchronous Projections:
   - Use hasql-transaction to run projections in database transactions
   - Compare performance vs STM-based projections
   - Test projection state consistency under concurrent updates

2. LISTEN/NOTIFY:
   - Set up PostgreSQL notification channels
   - Measure notification delivery latency
   - Test notification throughput and coalescing

3. Connection Pools:
   - Compare hasql pool strategies
   - Test pool exhaustion scenarios  
   - Measure connection establishment overhead

4. MVCC Features:
   - Test PostgreSQL-specific transaction isolation
   - Measure conflict resolution performance
   - Test version expectation mechanisms

These benchmarks would provide insights into PostgreSQL-specific optimizations
that don't apply to Memory or Filesystem stores.
