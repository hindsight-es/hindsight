# About Hindsight

Hindsight is an open-source event sourcing library for Haskell, designed to bring type safety and correctness to event-driven architectures.

## Project Goals

- **Type Safety**: Leverage Haskell's type system to prevent common event sourcing mistakes at compile time
- **Production Ready**: Built for real-world use with PostgreSQL backend and proper error handling
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and helpful error messages
- **Performance**: Efficient implementation with benchmarked performance characteristics

## Status

Hindsight is currently in active development. The core API is stabilizing, and we're working toward a 1.0 release. See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com) for current status and roadmap.
