# About Hindsight

Hindsight is an open-source event sourcing library for Haskell, designed to bring type safety and correctness to event-driven architectures.

## Project Goals

- **Type Safety**: Leverage Haskell's type system to prevent common event sourcing mistakes at compile time
- **Extensively Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with property-based testing, integration tests, and golden tests
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, and helpful error messages
- **Early Stage**: Functional core with PostgreSQL backend, APIs stabilizing toward 1.0

## Status

Hindsight is currently in active development. The core API is stabilizing, and we're working toward a 1.0 release.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether it's:

- Reporting bugs or requesting features
- Improving documentation
- Submitting pull requests

## Acknowledgments

Hindsight builds on the excellent work of the Haskell community, including libraries like:

- `aeson` for JSON serialization
- `stm` for concurrency primitives

Thank you to all contributors and the broader Haskell ecosystem.
